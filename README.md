Also, Spain has the highest number of users. Though Spain has the highest number of users, it did not generate the highest total monthly subscriptions.
United states had the highest monthly susbcriptions while Italy generated the least.

The subscription type that accounted for the highest revenue of $12,248 is Basic type.It accounts for almost 40% of the total revenue.
The standard type generated the least revenue.
