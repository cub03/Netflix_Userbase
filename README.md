This project is done to critically analyze Netflixâ€™s customer base, generate insights, and make decisions from the analysis.

## Problem Statement
1. Which country generated the highest revenue and had the highest number of users?
2. Which subscription type generated the highest revenue?

4. Which country had the highest number of monthly subscriptions?

## Skills Demonstrated

 ## Analysis
In 2022, Netflix generated a revenue of $30,635
The total number of users is 2448.
The total monthly subscriptions is 25,150.

The country that generated the hightest revenue is Spain with a revenue of $5,597 followed by United States and Canada.
Also, Spain has the highest number of users. Though Spain has the highest number of users, it did not generate the highest total monthly subscriptions.
United states had the highest monthly susbcriptions while Italy generated the least.
There isn't a lot of differenece in the revenue generated from France, Uk, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy and Mexico

The subscription type that accounted for the highest revenue of $12,248 is Basic type.It accounts for almost 40% of the total revenue.
The standard type generated the least revenue.

The age group of users that subscribe to Netflix the most are people aged between 41-51 years while people between 26-30years subscribe the least.
The devices used the most to access Netflix is laptops.

## Recommendation
I will recommend that ads about the premium subscription be targeted to the basic subscribers informing them about the benefits of upgrading as this would increase revenue.
Discount on subscriptions can be offered to countries like France, Uk, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy and Mexico. This is to encourage existing users to upgrade and give them a feel and experience of the premium subscription and increase the number of users.
